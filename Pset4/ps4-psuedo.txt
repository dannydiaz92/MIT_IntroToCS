Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:

Write and algorithm that decodes the maximum number of english words


for shift in range (1, 26)
    for letter in list shift by shift
        add letter to decrypted list
        count number of valid words
key = shift with max valid words


Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:

for shift in range(1,26)
    for word in list
        for letter in word
            shift by shift
